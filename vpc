Virtual Private Cloud(VPC):
----------------------------
- VPC is a network that can span across a cloud region which can consists of 'subnets' which individually can be confined to a single availability zone.

- VPC is logically a network of IP addresses that can be subdivided into networks known as 'subnets'

- each subnet is again a logical set of IP addresses that can be assigned to resources such as instances by a DHCP.

- VPC has few objects that govern the flow or traffic inside the VPC like
  - route tables
  - Network Access control lists(NACLs)
  - Security Groups
  
  - route table: will be used to route traffic inside the VPC and subnets
